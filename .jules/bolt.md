## 2026-10-10 - rANS and Match Copying Hot Loop Fast-Paths

**Learning:**
In zGEC, default single-context literal streams (`k = 1`) previously shared decoding, encoding, and histogram counting loops with multi-context streams (`k > 1`). Evaluating `if (k > 1)` and computing context table indices (`ti * 2048`) inside the 8-lane inner loops introduced unnecessary branch instructions and index math per literal byte. Specializing the `k = 1` loops removes these branches and allows tight, branchless lane iteration. In addition, when `n_tables = 1`, `zgec_rans_histograms` can bypass 8-lane geometry and run a simple sequential 4-unrolled loop `tables_counts[Z[i]]++`. For Phase B LZ77 execution, handling `off == 1` with `memset` and `off >= 16` with 16-byte unaligned `memcpy` significantly reduces match reconstruction latency.

**Action:**
When optimizing entropy coders or LZ77 match executors, always separate the single-context or common default fast-paths from multi-context fallback loops before unrolling or vectorizing.
